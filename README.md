# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

* In this Project we will build a machine learning model to analyse thousands of tweets to predict people's sentiments.

* It can automatically detect and categorize hate and racist tweets as well. So for any positive comment for instance "Good Morning everyone! Such a beautiful sunny day" , this model should be able to label it as POSITIVE (LABEL=0) and in case of any racist tweet label it as NEGATIVE (LABEL=1).
